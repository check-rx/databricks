# databricks
Used for databricks resources. Will hold data warehousing, lakehouse, data lake, ETL, and other data as well as scripts related to working with them within the databricks ecosystem. This could be replaced by another repo if we don't use databricks so data cleaning and ETL scripts should be able to be ran in other environments such as within python.
